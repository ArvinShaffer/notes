# Opentools

**Qt** is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing application software with graphical user interface (GUI). Qt is free and open source software distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License. In OCCT Qt is used for programming samples. If you need further information on Qt, refer to Qt Homepage (https://www.qt.io/)

**Tcl** is a high-level programming language. Tk is a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit, with buttons, menus, listboxes, scrollbars, and so on. Taken together Tcl and Tk provide a solution to develop cross-platform graphical user interfaces with a native look and feel. Tcl/Tk is under copyright by Scriptics Corp., Sun Microsystems, and other companies. However, Tcl/Tk is an open source, and the copyright allows you to use, modify, and redistribute Tcl/Tk for any purpose, without an explicit license agreement and without paying any license fees or royalties. To use Tcl/Tk, refer to the Licensing Terms (https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/license.html).

**FreeType 2** is developed by Antoine Leca, David Turner, Werner Lemberg and others. It is a software font engine that is designed to be small, efficient, highly customizable and portable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images). This product can be used in graphic libraries, display servers, font conversion tools, text image generation tools, and many other products. FreeType 2 is released under two open-source licenses: BSD-like FreeType License and the GPL (https://www.freetype.org/license.html).

**Intel(R) Threading Building Blocks (TBB)** offers a rich and complete approach to expressing parallelism in a C++ program. It is a library that helps you to take advantage of multi-core processor performance without having to be a threading expert. Threading Building Blocks is not just a threads-replacement library. It represents a higher-level, task-based parallelism that abstracts platform details and threading mechanisms for scalability and performance. TBB version 2017 is available under Apache 2.0 license, while older versions until 4.4 are available under GPLv2 license with the runtime exception ([https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org](https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org/)).

**OpenGL** is an industry standard API for 3D graphics used by OCCT for implementation of 3D viewer. OpenGL specification is developed by the Khronos group, https://www.khronos.org/opengl/. OCCT code includes header file *glext.h* obtained from Khronos web site.

**VTK** – The **Visualization Toolkit (VTK)** is an open-source, freely available software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing and visualization. OCCT VIS component provides adaptation functionality for visualization of OCCT topological shapes by means of VTK library. If you need further information on VTK, refer to VTK Homepage https://www.vtk.org/.

**Doxygen** developed by Dimitri van Heesch is open source documentation system for C++, C, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL, PHP and C#. This product is used in Open CASCADE Technology for automatic creation of Technical Documentation from C++ header files. If you need further information on Doxygen, refer to https://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html.

**Graphviz** is open source graph visualization software developed by John Ellson, Emden Gansner, Yifan Hu and Arif Bilgin. Graph visualization is representiation of structured information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. This product is used together with Doxygen in Open CASCADE Technology for automatic creation of Technical Documentation (generation of dependency graphs). Current versions of Graphviz are licensed on an open source basis under The Eclipse Public License (EPL) (https://www.graphviz.org/license/).

**Inno Setup** is a free script-driven installation system created in CodeGear Delphi by Jordan Russell. In OCCT Inno Setup is used to create Installation Wizard on Windows. It is licensed under Inno Setup License (http://www.jrsoftware.org/files/is/license.txt).

**FreeImage** is an Open Source library supporting popular graphics image formats, such as PNG, BMP, JPEG, TIFF, and others used by multimedia applications. This library is developed by Hervé Drolon and Floris van den Berg. FreeImage is easy to use, fast, multithreading safe, compatible with all 32-bit or 64-bit versions of Windows, and cross-platform (works both with Linux and Mac OS X). FreeImage is optionally used by OCCT to work with images, on conditions of the FreeImage Public License (FIPL) (https://freeimage.sourceforge.net/freeimage-license.txt).

**David M. Gay's floating point routines** (dtoa.c) are used for fast reading of floating point values from text strings. These routines are available under MIT-like license (see https://www.netlib.org/fp/).

**CMake** is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, test and package software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process using simple platform and compiler independent configuration files, and generate native makefiles and workspaces that can be used in the compiler environment of your choice. OCCT uses CMake as a build system. CMake is available under BSD 3-Clause license. See more at https://cmake.org/

**Cotire** (compile time reducer) is a CMake module that speeds up the build process of CMake based build systems by fully automating techniques as precompiled header usage and single compilation unit builds for C and C++. Cotire is included in OCCT repository and used optionally by OCCT CMake scripts to accelerate builds by use of precompiled headers. Cotire is licensed under the MIT license (https://github.com/sakra/cotire/blob/master/license).

**FFmpeg** is an Open Source framework supporting various image, video and audio codecs. FFmpeg is optionally used by OCCT for video recording, on LGPL conditions (https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html).

**MikTEX** is up-to-date implementation of TeX/LaTeX and related programs for Windows. It is used for generation of User and Developer Guides in PDF format. See [https://miktex.org](https://miktex.org/) for information on this tool.

**RapidJSON** is an Open Source JSON parser and generator for C++. RapidJSON is optionally used by OCCT for reading glTF files (https://rapidjson.org/).

Adobe Systems, Inc. provides **Adobe Reader**, which can be used to view files in Portable Document Format (PDF).

# Documentation

OCCT documentation is provided in several forms:

- This overview provides general description of OCCT structure, functionality, modules, and features. It is available in HTML format (generated by Doxygen) and includes User and Developer Guides. The sources of this documentation are contained in **dox** subdirectory of OCCT sources (plain text format is used, with mixed MarkDown / Doxygen syntax mark-up).
- User and Developer Guides describing in details OCCT modules and development tools are also available in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF). To read this format, you need Adobe Acrobat Reader, which is a freeware and can be downloaded from the Adobe site.
- Full reference documentation covering all OCCT classes generated automatically by Doxygen software is provided in HTML format. Reference documentation is presented in **Modules –> Toolkits –> Packages –> Classes** logic structure with cross-references to all OCCT classes and complete in-browser search by all classes.

See [OCCT Documentation Guide](https://old.opencascade.com/doc/occt-7.4.0/overview/html/occt_dev_guides__documentation.html) for details on OCCT documentation system.

**Generation of HTML documentation**

To generate HTML documentation from sources contained in *dox* subdirectory, you need to have Tcl and Doxygen 1.8.5 (or above) installed on your system.

Use script **gendoc** (batch file on Windows, shell script on Linux / Mac OSX) to generate documentation.

To generate Overview documentation:

```
cmd> gendoc -overview
```

To generate Reference manual:

```
cmd> gendoc -refman
```

Run this command without arguments to get help on supported options.
